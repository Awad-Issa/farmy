# Argon2 Webpack Bundling Error Fix

**Date:** October 20, 2024  
**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED

---

## Issue

Next.js was failing to start with webpack bundling errors:

```
Module parse failed: Unexpected token (1:0)
You may need an appropriate loader to handle this file type
> <!doctype html>

Import trace:
argon2/argon2.js
‚Üí packages/auth/src/password.ts
‚Üí packages/api/src/trpc.ts
‚Üí apps/web/src/app/api/trpc/[trpc]/route.ts
```

---

## Root Cause

**Argon2 is a native Node.js module** (uses C++ bindings via node-gyp) and cannot be bundled by webpack for browser/edge runtime.

### Why This Happens:

1. `argon2` package contains native C++ code compiled for Node.js
2. Webpack tries to bundle everything for the browser
3. Webpack encounters HTML files and other non-JS files in the native module
4. Bundling fails because webpack doesn't know how to handle native modules

### The Import Chain:

```
apps/web/src/app/api/trpc/[trpc]/route.ts
  ‚Üì imports
packages/api/src/trpc.ts
  ‚Üì imports
packages/auth/src/password.ts
  ‚Üì imports
argon2 (native module ‚ùå)
```

---

## Solution

### 1. Force Node.js Runtime ‚úÖ

Added runtime configuration to the tRPC API route:

**File:** `apps/web/src/app/api/trpc/[trpc]/route.ts`

```typescript
// Force Node.js runtime (required for native modules like argon2)
export const runtime = 'nodejs';
```

This tells Next.js to run this API route in Node.js runtime (not Edge runtime), which supports native modules.

---

### 2. Externalize Native Modules in Webpack ‚úÖ

Updated Next.js config to exclude native modules from webpack bundling:

**File:** `apps/web/next.config.js`

```javascript
webpack: (config, { isServer }) => {
  if (isServer) {
    // Externalize native modules for server-side
    config.externals = config.externals || [];
    config.externals.push({
      'argon2': 'commonjs argon2',
      '@mapbox/node-pre-gyp': 'commonjs @mapbox/node-pre-gyp',
    });
  }
  return config;
}
```

This tells webpack:
- Don't try to bundle `argon2` 
- Don't try to bundle `@mapbox/node-pre-gyp` (argon2 dependency)
- Use the installed node_modules version at runtime instead

---

## Files Modified

1. ‚úÖ `apps/web/src/app/api/trpc/[trpc]/route.ts` - Added `runtime = 'nodejs'`
2. ‚úÖ `apps/web/next.config.js` - Added webpack externals configuration

---

## How It Works Now

### Before (‚ùå Failed):
```
1. Next.js tries to bundle API route
2. Webpack encounters argon2 native module
3. Webpack tries to bundle C++ bindings and HTML files
4. Bundling fails with "Module parse failed"
```

### After (‚úÖ Works):
```
1. Next.js sees runtime = 'nodejs'
2. Webpack externalizes argon2 (doesn't bundle it)
3. API route runs in Node.js runtime
4. Argon2 is loaded from node_modules at runtime
5. Password hashing works correctly
```

---

## Testing

After this fix, verify:

1. **Development Server Starts** ‚úÖ
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   # Should start without webpack errors
   ```

2. **API Route Works** ‚úÖ
   - Navigate to http://localhost:3000/api/trpc
   - Should not show 500 error

3. **Authentication Works** ‚úÖ
   - Try to login (when backend is set up)
   - Password hashing should work

4. **No Console Errors** ‚úÖ
   - Check terminal for webpack errors
   - Should be clean

---

## Why Argon2?

We use **Argon2id** for password hashing because:

1. **Most Secure** - Winner of Password Hashing Competition (2015)
2. **GPU-Resistant** - Protects against GPU/ASIC attacks
3. **Memory-Hard** - Requires significant RAM, making brute force expensive
4. **Recommended** - OWASP, NIST, and security experts recommend it
5. **Better than bcrypt** - More resistant to modern attacks

### Alternatives (Not Recommended):

- ‚ùå **bcrypt** - Older, less secure against GPU attacks
- ‚ùå **scrypt** - Good but not as widely supported
- ‚ùå **pbkdf2** - Too fast, easier to brute force
- ‚ùå **md5/sha** - Never use for passwords!

## Other Native Modules

If you add other native Node.js modules in the future, you'll need to:

1. Add `runtime = 'nodejs'` to API routes that use them
2. Add them to webpack externals in `next.config.js`

**Common native modules:**
- `argon2` - Password hashing (we use this)
- `bcrypt` - Password hashing (alternative)
- `sharp` - Image processing
- `sqlite3` - SQLite database
- `node-gyp` - Native addon build tool

---

## Production Deployment

This fix works in production because:

1. **Vercel/Netlify** - Support Node.js runtime
2. **Docker** - Can include native modules
3. **VPS/Cloud** - Full Node.js environment

Make sure your deployment platform:
- ‚úÖ Supports Node.js runtime (not just Edge)
- ‚úÖ Has build tools for native modules (node-gyp, python, gcc)
- ‚úÖ Runs `pnpm install` which compiles native modules

---

## Summary

‚úÖ **Fixed:** Webpack no longer tries to bundle argon2  
‚úÖ **Fixed:** API routes run in Node.js runtime  
‚úÖ **Fixed:** Native modules work correctly  
‚úÖ **Result:** Development server starts without errors  

**The app should now start successfully!** üéâ

---

## Next Steps

Now that the server starts, you can:

1. **Set up database** - PostgreSQL connection
2. **Run migrations** - Create tables
3. **Test authentication** - Login/register
4. **Add features** - Build the rest of the app

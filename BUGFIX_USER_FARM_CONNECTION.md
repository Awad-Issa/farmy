# 🐛 BUGFIX: User-Farm Connection

**Date:** October 22, 2024  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

---

## 🔍 Issue Identified

**Problem:** Users were not connected to any farm after registration.

### What Was Wrong:

1. **Registration Endpoint:**
   - Created user account
   - ❌ Did NOT create a farm
   - ❌ Did NOT create farm membership
   - Result: User had no farm to work with

2. **Login Endpoint:**
   - Returned user data and tokens
   - ❌ Did NOT return farm information
   - Result: Frontend couldn't set the farmId

3. **Dashboard:**
   - Expected a farmId to be present
   - ❌ No fallback for users without farms
   - Result: Dashboard would fail or show nothing

---

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### 1. **Updated Registration Endpoint** (`packages/api/src/routers/auth.ts`)

**Changes:**
- ✅ Automatically creates a default farm for new users
- ✅ Farm name: `"{User's Name}'s Farm"` or `"My Farm"` if no name provided
- ✅ Creates farm membership with `OWNER` role
- ✅ Returns farm data along with user data

**Code Added:**
```typescript
// Create default farm for new user
const farmName = input.name ? `${input.name}'s Farm` : 'My Farm';
const farm = await ctx.prisma.farm.create({
  data: {
    name: farmName,
    ownerId: user.id,
    settings: {},
  },
});

// Add user as owner of the farm
await ctx.prisma.farmMember.create({
  data: {
    farmId: farm.id,
    userId: user.id,
    role: 'OWNER',
  },
});

// Return farm data
return {
  user: { ... },
  farm: {
    id: farm.id,
    name: farm.name,
  },
  accessToken,
  refreshToken,
};
```

---

### 2. **Updated Login Endpoint** (`packages/api/src/routers/auth.ts`)

**Changes:**
- ✅ Fetches user's first farm after successful authentication
- ✅ Returns farm data along with user data
- ✅ Handles users without farms gracefully (returns null)

**Code Added:**
```typescript
// Get user's first farm (if any)
const farmMember = await ctx.prisma.farmMember.findFirst({
  where: { userId: user.id },
  include: { farm: true },
  orderBy: { createdAt: 'asc' },
});

return {
  user: { ... },
  farm: farmMember ? {
    id: farmMember.farm.id,
    name: farmMember.farm.name,
  } : null,
  accessToken,
  refreshToken,
};
```

---

### 3. **Updated Register Page** (`apps/web/src/app/[locale]/(auth)/register/page.tsx`)

**Changes:**
- ✅ Stores farm ID from registration response
- ✅ Sets current farm ID in localStorage

**Code Updated:**
```typescript
onSuccess: async (data) => {
  setAuthToken(data.accessToken);
  setRefreshToken(data.refreshToken);
  localStorage.setItem('user', JSON.stringify(data.user));
  
  // Store farm ID (automatically created during registration)
  if (data.farm) {
    setCurrentFarmId(data.farm.id);
  }
  
  router.push(`/${locale}/dashboard`);
}
```

---

### 4. **Updated Login Page** (`apps/web/src/app/[locale]/(auth)/login/page.tsx`)

**Changes:**
- ✅ Stores farm ID from login response
- ✅ Removed hardcoded test farm ID

**Code Updated:**
```typescript
onSuccess: async (data) => {
  setAuthToken(data.accessToken);
  setRefreshToken(data.refreshToken);
  localStorage.setItem('user', JSON.stringify(data.user));
  
  // Store farm ID if user has a farm
  if (data.farm) {
    setCurrentFarmId(data.farm.id);
  }
  
  router.push(`/${locale}/dashboard`);
}
```

---

### 5. **Updated Dashboard** (`apps/web/src/app/[locale]/(app)/dashboard/page.tsx`)

**Changes:**
- ✅ Added fallback UI for users without farms
- ✅ Shows helpful message if farmId is missing

**Code Added:**
```typescript
// Show message if no farm
if (!farmId) {
  return (
    <div className="flex flex-col items-center justify-center h-full">
      <div className="text-center max-w-md">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Welcome to Farmy!</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6">
          It looks like you don't have a farm set up yet. Please contact support or create a farm to get started.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## 🎯 Complete Flow Now

### Registration Flow:
```
User registers with phone + password + name
              ↓
Backend creates:
  1. User account
  2. Default farm ("{Name}'s Farm")
  3. Farm membership (OWNER role)
              ↓
Returns: user data + farm data + tokens
              ↓
Frontend stores:
  - Access token (localStorage + cookie)
  - Refresh token (localStorage + cookie)
  - User data (localStorage)
  - Farm ID (localStorage)
              ↓
Redirect to dashboard with active farm ✅
```

### Login Flow:
```
User logs in with phone + password
              ↓
Backend validates credentials
              ↓
Fetches user's first farm
              ↓
Returns: user data + farm data + tokens
              ↓
Frontend stores:
  - Access token (localStorage + cookie)
  - Refresh token (localStorage + cookie)
  - User data (localStorage)
  - Farm ID (localStorage)
              ↓
Redirect to dashboard with active farm ✅
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Test 1: New User Registration

1. **Register a new account:**
   ```
   Name: Test User
   Phone: +970599123456
   Password: password123
   ```

2. **Expected Results:**
   - ✅ User account created
   - ✅ Farm created: "Test User's Farm"
   - ✅ User is OWNER of the farm
   - ✅ Redirected to dashboard
   - ✅ Dashboard shows farm data (0 animals initially)

3. **Verify in Database:**
   ```bash
   pnpm db:studio
   ```
   - Check `users` table: New user exists
   - Check `farms` table: New farm exists with user as owner
   - Check `farm_members` table: Membership exists with OWNER role

---

### Test 2: Existing User Login

1. **Login with test credentials:**
   ```
   Phone: +970591234567
   Password: password123
   ```

2. **Expected Results:**
   - ✅ Login successful
   - ✅ Farm ID loaded from database
   - ✅ Redirected to dashboard
   - ✅ Dashboard shows farm data (3 test animals)

---

### Test 3: User Without Farm (Edge Case)

This shouldn't happen with new registrations, but if a user somehow doesn't have a farm:

1. **Dashboard shows:**
   - Welcome message
   - Instructions to create a farm

---

## 📊 Database Changes

### Tables Affected:

1. **`users`** - User accounts
2. **`farms`** - Farm records
3. **`farm_members`** - User-Farm relationships

### Relationships:

```
User (1) ----< (many) FarmMember (many) >---- (1) Farm
                                                  |
                                                owner
                                                  |
                                                User
```

Each user can:
- Own multiple farms (as ownerId)
- Be a member of multiple farms (via farm_members)
- Have different roles in different farms (OWNER, MANAGER, WORKER, VIEWER)

## 🔄 Migration for Existing Users

If you have existing users without farms (from before this fix):

### Option 1: Manual via Prisma Studio
1. Open Prisma Studio: `pnpm db:studio`
2. Create a farm for the user
3. Create a farm_member record linking user to farm

### Option 2: SQL Script
```sql
-- For each user without a farm
INSERT INTO farms (id, name, owner_id, settings, created_at, updated_at)
VALUES (gen_random_uuid(), 'My Farm', 'USER_ID_HERE', '{}', NOW(), NOW());

-- Then create membership
INSERT INTO farm_members (id, farm_id, user_id, role, created_at, updated_at)
VALUES (gen_random_uuid(), 'FARM_ID_HERE', 'USER_ID_HERE', 'OWNER', NOW(), NOW());
```

Transformed the animal detail page from a basic "Animal not found" placeholder into a comprehensive animal management interface with multiple action tabs.

## What Was Changed

## Technical Implementation

### Data Fetching Strategy
- **Lazy Loading**: Each tab's data is only fetched when the tab is active
- **Conditional Queries**: Uses tRPC's `enabled` option to prevent unnecessary API calls
- **Efficient Queries**: Fetches only the data needed for each tab

### API Endpoints Used
- `trpc.animals.get` - Main animal data with includes
- `trpc.breeding.cycles.list` - Breeding cycles
- `trpc.health.events.list` - Health events
- `trpc.weights.list` - Weight records
- `trpc.milk.yields.list` - Milk yield records
- `trpc.sales.list` - Sales records

### UI/UX Improvements
- **Responsive Design**: Grid layouts adapt to screen size
- **Loading States**: Shows loading indicator while fetching data
- **Empty States**: Each tab has a meaningful empty state with icon
- **Color Coding**: Consistent use of colors for status indicators
- **Hover Effects**: Interactive elements have hover states
- **Overflow Handling**: Tables and tabs scroll horizontally on small screens

### Internationalization
- Uses `next-intl` for all text translations
- Supports both English and Arabic
- Date formatting respects locale

## User Benefits

1. **Complete Animal Overview**: All information about an animal in one place
2. **Quick Actions**: Add buttons on each tab for fast data entry
3. **Visual Clarity**: Icons, colors, and cards make information easy to scan
4. **Data Organization**: Logical grouping of related information
5. **Historical Tracking**: View complete history across all categories
6. **Performance**: Only loads data when needed

## Future Enhancements

### Suggested Improvements
1. **Weight Chart**: Add line chart visualization for weight trends
2. **Edit Functionality**: Implement edit modals for each record type
3. **Delete Actions**: Add ability to remove incorrect records
4. **Export Data**: Allow exporting animal data to PDF/CSV
5. **Print View**: Optimized printing layout for animal records
6. **Photo Gallery**: Add animal photos section
7. **Notes Section**: General notes/observations about the animal
8. **Activity Timeline**: Unified timeline of all events

### Modal Integration
The "Add" buttons are ready to integrate with modals for:
- Adding breeding cycles
